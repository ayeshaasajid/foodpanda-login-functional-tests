# foodpanda-login-functional-tests
Functional test cases for the Foodpanda login page to validate core authentication features.
This repository contains a comprehensive set of functional test cases designed to verify the login functionality of the Foodpanda web application. These test cases focus on ensuring that all key aspects of the login processâ€”such as input validation, error handling, successful authentication, and user redirectionâ€”are working as expected under different scenarios.

## ðŸ“„ Test Cases File

The Excel file `foodpanda_login_testcases.xlsx` contains test cases for the following scenarios:
- **Valid credentials**: Ensures the user can log in with correct credentials.
- **Invalid credentials**: Ensures the system handles wrong credentials appropriately.
- **Empty fields**: Verifies that required fields are being validated.
- **Password visibility**: Ensures the password field hides the entered password.
- **Error messages**: Verifies that the correct error messages are displayed.
- **Successful login**: Verifies that the user is redirected to the correct page after a successful login.

## ðŸ› Tools and Environment

- **Testing Tool**: Manual Testing (can be automated with Selenium, Postman, etc.)
- **File Format**: `.xlsx` (Excel)

## How to Use

1. Download the Excel file `foodpanda_login_testcases.xlsx` from this repository.
2. Review the test cases and execute them against the Foodpanda login page.
